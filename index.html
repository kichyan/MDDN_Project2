              <p>The online identity is a fake identity people build on the web. We will never know who he or she is behind the web. At the very first, we get the first expression of the person by his or her profile photo, Or the character that he/she plays in a MMORGP game. Next is the speaking style, the photo of his blog. The sound of his or her voice may another way to know a person. But do you know how much you know him/her is true? Do you really know who is the one sitting in fount of the screen? </p>

              <p>The emoticon is a really interesting way for people to communicate. They use the emoji to show their feeling, mood and reaction. I choose several emoticons to show the Chinese kind emoji, which is has become an online culture. This kind of emoji is always a kind of low resolution picture. The most famous should be the panda emotion. The face of the panda is putted on different of interesting faces and wildly used on the online social platform. Other kinds emoticon like animal emoji is also popular. The emoticon is an important way to build the online identity. Form the using of the emoji, we can kind know his or her personality. The group of people who use the similar emoticon are always get along well.</p>
